# Automating Real-World Tasks with Python

This repository contains the Python projects I've constructed for the completion of the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate (Course 6).

There are four projects (i.e. "weeks")--each that correspond to the four modules in Course 6 for the Certificate program.

## Modules/Weeks

1. Manipulating Images
2. Interacting with Web Services
3. Automatic Output Generation
4. Putting It All Together

## Skills Demonstrated

- Use Python external libraries to create and modify documents, images, and messages
- Understand and use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to interact with web services
- Understand and use data serialization to send messages between running programs
- Build a solution using the skills acquired over the Certificate course
